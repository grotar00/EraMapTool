Developed using Godot engine:

#### What is this?
Editor for creating locations in Emuera games, supports a mix of 1-byte and 2-byte symbols and special animated effects.
Initially this was made for eraTW but should work with any similar project. May be used for sketching UI or making text images on a 64x42 canvas.

#### How to work with it?
You can import an existing map following a template or drag&drop any type of image to use it as a reference.
All controls and hotkeys are mentioned within the editor.

#### What formats does it work with?
Both JSON and ERB may be used for import/export. Colors are output in 0xFFFFFF format.

#### How to install?
Not required, just run executable.

#### Can I modify the code?
Why not?

#### I have another question.
